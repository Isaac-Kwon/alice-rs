# alice-sys

This crate contains the bindgen generated bindings to a c++ object which reads the data from disk.

The c++ class is automatically generated by ROOT's TTree::MakeClass function specifically for the Event-Summary-Data (ESD) dataformat at hand.

The compilation of this crate requires a ROOT 5 or 6 installation.
